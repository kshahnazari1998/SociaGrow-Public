The final step is to deploy the flutter webapp so that the users have a interface to communicate with the models we just built. 

1) After installing flutter create a new flutter Application and replace the assets, lib folder with the ones in this folder. Also match the pubspec.yaml with the ones in this folder.

2) Add the credentials of your Firebase database to your build folder.

3) Test the code on an Android and IPhone emulator

4) The final step is to release the app. Follow the instructions at https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android and https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/ios
