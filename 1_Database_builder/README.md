 
The first part of the pipeline is to create a DataBase for the data to be saved to. You could use whatever service you want to host your database, but our recommendation is to use either AWS or google cloud. We used AWS to create the database. 

When setting up MySQL, select version 8.0.20; using the newer versions would probably not break the system because basic SQL commands are being used in the scripts. Take note of the database name and the username and password of the user you create for you SQL database.

After setting up the database, either copy and paste the SQL code in this folder and execute or use an interface to upload the file and then execute the commands.

Have your host address, username and password ready as needed in the next step of the deployment.
